* Library.
A simple toy library frontend built to re-familiarize myself with some old things and learn some new ones too.
** Tech
- svelte for the frontend being served and bundled by vite.
- tailwind for easy css
- c# asp.net backend using EF core for DB interaction.
** Running.
Presently to develop you run the dotnet backend using ~dotnet run~ and the web host by running ~pnpm run vite~ from within the svelte-app folder.
This split system allows us to use vite's support for hot module reloading.
